## Model Architecture
The system employs a deep CNN architecture with multiple layers designed to capture intricate patterns in the leaf images:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps, retaining essential features.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Combine features to classify images into respective disease categories.
- **Softmax Output:** Produces probability distributions over 38 classes, identifying the most likely disease category.

## Training Process
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase dataset variability and improve model robustness.
- **Optimization:** Used Adam optimizer with a learning rate of `0.001`, tuned for optimal performance.
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss was minimized over multiple epochs to ensure accurate classification.
- **Validation:** Monitored validation accuracy to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability.

## Results
- The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 96% on the test dataset.
- Visualizations of training metrics (accuracy, loss) are provided in the notebook, demonstrating the model's learning curve.

## Usage
1. **Inference:** To run inference on new images:
    ```python
    from predict import predict_disease
    result = predict_disease('path_to_leaf_image.jpg')
    print(result)
    ```
2. **Visualization:** Use provided scripts to visualize predictions and the corresponding probabilities.

## Future Work
- **Model Improvements:** Explore advanced architectures such as EfficientNet or Transformer-based models to further enhance accuracy.
- **Real-time Deployment:** Implement a real-time disease detection system using edge devices such as Raspberry Pi.
- **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile application for farmers to easily use the model for disease detection in the field.
